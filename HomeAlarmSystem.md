Home security system
Motion sensor – detect unauthorized motion within a real space
Arduino board – breadboard, each motion sensor represents each room 
How to use: turn on security system before leaving the house
How it works: when unauthorized motion is detected from motion sensors, the alarm system will activate within the house to alert neighbors and/or scare away the intruder. A signal will be sent to physically lock the door

The door will have motors to ensure that it cannot be opened once the alarm system is activated. This will prevent the intruders from escaping the house.
